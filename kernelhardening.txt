1. Kernel Parameter Tuning (sysctl)
The Linux kernel's behavior is controlled by various parameters, which you can modify at runtime using the sysctl utility. For permanent changes, edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file or add new files in /etc/sysctl.d/.

Here are some essential hardening settings:

Parameter	Recommended Value	Description
net.ipv4.ip_forward	0	Disables IP forwarding, preventing the system from acting as a router.
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route	0	Disables acceptance of source-routed packets, which can be used for network manipulation.
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects	0	Disables ICMP redirect acceptance, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks.
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects	0	Disables ICMP send redirects, preventing the system from advertising itself as a router.
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter	1	Enables Reverse Path Filtering (RPF) (strict mode), helping protect against IP spoofing.
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts	1	Ignores ICMP echo requests sent to broadcast/multicast addresses, mitigating "Smurf" attacks.
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies	1	Enables TCP SYN Cookies, providing protection against SYN flood denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
kernel.dmesg_restrict	1	Restricts non-root users from using dmesg to view kernel log information, which can sometimes leak sensitive kernel addresses.
kernel.kptr_restrict	1 or 2	Hides kernel pointer addresses in /proc and other interfaces from non-privileged users. 2 is more restrictive.
fs.protected_hardlinks	1	Prevents the creation of hard links to files that the user doesn't own, mitigating certain attacks.
fs.protected_symlinks	1	Prevents race condition attacks involving symbolic links in world-writable sticky directories.

Export to Sheets
To apply changes permanently:

Add the desired entries to a new file like /etc/sysctl.d/99-security-hardening.conf.

Run sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-security-hardening.conf to load the changes immediately.
